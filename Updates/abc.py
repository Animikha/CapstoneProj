# Step 1: Load the saved model
model = tensorflow.saved_model.load("modelRNN.h5")

# Step 2: Load the CSV sample
# Assuming your CSV file has headers and the sample is stored in 'sample.csv'
sample_df = pd.read_csv('validate.csv')

# Step 3: Preprocess the sample
# You may need to preprocess the sample data to match the format expected by your model
# This could involve tasks such as converting categorical variables to numerical, scaling numerical data, etc.
# Ensure that the preprocessing steps are consistent with how the model was trained
# Replace 'preprocess_sample' with your preprocessing function

# Step 4: Make predictions
# Reshape the input to match the shape expected by the model
 
predictions = model.predict(sample_df)

# Step 5: Postprocess predictions if necessary
# Example: Convert probabilities to class labels or perform any other necessary transformation
# Postprocessing function depends on your task

# Example of how to use the predictions
